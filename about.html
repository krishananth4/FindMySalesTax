                The purpose of this application is to provide an easy and accessible way to find
                the sales tax of whatever location that you are interested in. We use an interactive
                map that will allow a user to click on a particular location and display the
                corresponiding sales tax. The motivation behind this project was to develop an application
                that has all the sales tax data rounded up in in a singular page with all the data readily
                available. One of our priorities was to provide sales tax information to the user in any
                georgaphical region/county in the United States through the use of an simple map.
